# Street Beat

## Full-stack capstone project

Street Beat is a site specifically designed for members of the international street band community - think guerrilla marching bands, a la New Orleans. On Street Beat, band members can sign up for an individual profile and use a private dashboard to manage the bands that they are in.  including repertoire list, a place to easily post set lists for gigs and practices,

I built this app with a number of longer-term goals in mind. In future versions, band pages will be exclusive to those who are confirmed members (verified by an admin/owner in each band), and will be a central place to keep useful resources that are typically decentralized (if they exist at all). I hope to integrate/reference important external resources, including bands' public websites, calendars, gig-o-matic attendance pages, and more.

My priorities revolve around band-facing functionality, but I eventually intend to allow users to connect with other users outside of the band context. Ideas for this will be in continual development, but one such idea is a master calendar/events page to connect bands and festivals across the world.

I am so far uninterested in overseeing the community to the extent that would be required if chat/messaging were to be added, so for now, that will remain off the table.
